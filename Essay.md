My personality strength has determined I am data driven and have a craftsman mindset. I like to seek the why behind everything. Constantly learning is my motto.

Developers take an idea and create a vision of how that idea should materialize in reality. When I heard of it, I knew this will be my next step. The timing when I heard Ada Developers Academy was perfect. Ada’s mission-driven mission is another reason why I want to be part of Ada. I’ve been trying to take [Code Academy Courses](https://www.codecademy.com/).*
